##figure out how to properly read the data?
##find out why reading the buttons gives you 0 when clean is pressed and not
##I put a stream function in interface to maybe help with catching the data from the sensor

##If figured out above test out the penta method does it work?
##If not try to play around with the values untill they are close enough
##Does the timer work? If not try to put all of the times to 9 s or try to read the section on timer in threading


## finish report (update)
